* 🌱 Hi, this is Catalina! I am currently responsible for data cleansing, quantitative analysis, model maintenance, and visualization in the information services and publishing industry. I use SQL, Python, and Tableau, and also write business reports. Additionally, I run a personal Value Investment Analysis Website where I regularly update financial reports on GitHub.
* Previously, I worked for three years as a Spanish-speaking business developer, specializing in digital marketing and the development of the Latin American market. Since transitioning into data analysis, I have focused on enhancing my skills in data analysis and machine learning. Let's leave a message and discuss and exchange ideas! 🤲🤝
