* 🌱 Hi, this is Catalina! I am currently responsible for data cleansing, quantitative analysis, model maintenance, and visualization in the information services and publishing industry. I use SQL, Python, and Tableau, and also write business reports. Additionally, I run a personal value investment analysis website where I regularly update financial reports on GitHub.

Since transitioning into data analysis, I have focused on enhancing my skills in data analysis and machine learning. Let's leave a message and discuss and exchange ideas! 🤲🤝
